# interactive_Login_with_rive

## Getting Started

This app is a fully functional Login and Registration App that uses Flutter for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. The login and registration pages have been designed with interactive animations to enhance the user experience and make the app more visually appealing. The animations are implemented using the  Rive (https://rive.app/community/) and are triggered by user interactions.

The app uses Firebase Authentication to handle user login and registration. Users can create an account by providing their email and password, and then use those credentials to log in to the app. Firebase also handles password recovery and account verification.

The app also uses Firebase Firestore to store user data. When a user creates an account, their information is stored in a Firestore database, which can be accessed by the app to provide a personalized experience. The app also uses Firebase Cloud Functions to add additional security and functionality to the app.
